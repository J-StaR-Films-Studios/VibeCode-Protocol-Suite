# Workflow: Finalize Build

> Run final verification and generate the complete handoff report.
> Use when all MUS features are implemented (or user says "ship it").

---

## Steps

### 1. Full Verification

Run the complete verification suite:

```bash
python scripts/vibe-verify.py
```

**All checks must pass:**
- ✅ TypeScript: PASS
- ✅ Lint: PASS
- ✅ Build: PASS

**If any check fails:** Fix it before proceeding.

---

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Audit

Scan all issue files and verify completion:

```powershell
# Count completed vs incomplete
Get-Content docs/issues/*.md | Select-String "- \[x\]" | Measure-Object
Get-Content docs/issues/*.md | Select-String "- \[ \]" | Measure-Object
```

**Generate report:**

```
📋 **Acceptance Criteria Audit**

| FR | Title | Criteria | Completed |
|----|-------|----------|-----------|
| FR-001 | Auth | 5/5 | ✅ |
| FR-002 | Dashboard | 4/4 | ✅ |
| FR-003 | Settings | 3/3 | ✅ |

**Result:** All MUS criteria verified ✅
```

**If incomplete criteria exist:**
- List them
- Ask user: "Proceed anyway or fix first?"

---

### 3. Generate Final Handoff Report

Create `docs/Builder_Handoff_Report.md`:

```markdown
